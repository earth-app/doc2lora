Software Development Best Practices

Version Control Management:
- Use Git for all projects with clear commit messages
- Create feature branches for new development work
- Perform code reviews before merging to main branch
- Tag releases with semantic versioning
- Maintain a clean commit history through squashing

Code Quality Standards:
- Write self-documenting code with meaningful variable names
- Follow language-specific style guides (PEP 8 for Python, ESLint for JavaScript)
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Use consistent indentation and formatting
- Remove dead code and unused imports regularly

Testing Methodology:
- Write unit tests for all business logic functions
- Implement integration tests for API endpoints
- Use test-driven development (TDD) when appropriate
- Maintain minimum 80% code coverage
- Run automated tests in CI/CD pipeline

Security Practices:
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Keep dependencies updated to patch security vulnerabilities
- Store sensitive data using encryption
- Never commit secrets or API keys to version control

Performance Optimization:
- Profile code to identify bottlenecks
- Optimize database queries with proper indexing
- Implement caching strategies where appropriate
- Use lazy loading for large datasets
- Monitor application performance in production

Collaboration Guidelines:
- Participate actively in code reviews
- Share knowledge through documentation and team sessions
- Follow agreed-upon coding conventions
- Communicate clearly about design decisions
- Ask for help when stuck to avoid prolonged blocking
